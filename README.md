## How It Works

> **Pipeline Overview**

1. Code is uploaded or pasted by the user.
2.  Code is chunked to avoid token overflows.
3.  Prompts are structured using LangChain’s `PromptTemplate`.
4.  Gemini 2.0 Flash processes and explains each chunk.
5.  Output is cleaned, filtered for duplicates, and displayed in real-time.
6.  User can ask follow-up queries; LLM replies intelligently.
7.  Explanation can be downloaded instantly.

**Architecture**: Built on a modular LangChain pipeline with prompt control, Gemini model abstraction, and semantic filtering for duplicate prevention.
